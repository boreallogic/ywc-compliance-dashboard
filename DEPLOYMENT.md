## Troubleshooting Deployment

### Build Fails

**Problem:** "Command failed: npm run build"

**Solutions:**
- Ensure `package.json` has correct scripts
- Check Node version: Should be 18+
- Run `npm install` locally first to verify

### 404 Errors After Deployment

**Problem:** Routes don't work, getting 404

**Solution:**
- Check that `netlify.toml` exists with redirect rules
- Should redirect `/*` to `/index.html`

### Large Bundle Size Warning

**Problem:** "Large page size"

**Solution:**
- This is normal for data-heavy dashboards
- Charts and PDF libraries are large
- Consider code splitting if needed later

---

## Cost Estimate

**Netlify Free Tier includes:**
- ‚úÖ 100GB bandwidth/month (plenty for small teams)
- ‚úÖ Unlimited sites
- ‚úÖ Automatic SSL
- ‚úÖ CDN

## Security Considerations

‚úÖ **This app is secure because:**
- All data processing is client-side
- No backend or database
- No user authentication needed
- No API keys or secrets
- HTTPS by default on Netlify

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Since data is stored in browser localStorage:
- Users should not use incognito/private mode for persistent data
- Clearing browser data will delete stored indicators
- Data is not shared between devices

---

## Backup Strategy

Since this is a client-side app:
1. Users should keep their CSV files as backups
2. Consider periodic CSV exports as snapshots
3. If using Git, all code is backed up automatically
