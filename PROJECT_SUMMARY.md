## 🎓 What Exec Directors Need to Know

From QUICK_START.md:

1. **Upload CSV** (drag & drop)
2. **Browse indicators** (search & filter)
3. **Generate reports** (pick funder, click PDF)
4. **Track trends** (upload quarterly)

That's it. Simple workflow, professional output.

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Once deployed, this dashboard will:
- ✅ Reduce report generation time from hours to minutes
- ✅ Eliminate manual Excel wrangling
- ✅ Provide consistent, professional funder reports
- ✅ Enable data-driven decisions via trend analysis
- ✅ Support quarterly compliance requirements
- ✅ Scale to multiple organizations if needed later

---

## 🙏 What I Assumed

Based on brief and CSV data:
- Single organization per CSV (Victoria Faulkner Women's Centre)
- Quarterly manual uploads (no API integrations)
- PDF + CSV export sufficient (not Word/Excel)
- Client-side filtering acceptable (all data in memory)
- Executive directors have basic computer skills
- Tablets = iPads, Android tablets, similar devices

**If any assumptions wrong, these are easy to adjust.**

---

## 🔄 Future Enhancements (Not Built, But Easy to Add)

- User authentication (if multi-org)
- Backend database (if sharing data)
- Word/Excel report exports
- Email report delivery
- Custom report templates per funder
- Progress tracking per indicator (not just counts)
- Multi-language support

**Current version is MVP - fully functional, production-ready.**

---

## 📞 Support Path

1. **Documentation**: Start with QUICK_START.md
2. **Technical issues**: README.md troubleshooting section
3. **Deployment issues**: DEPLOYMENT.md
4. **Code questions**: All code is commented

**I built this to be maintainable without me.**

## ⟡SCAR⟡ Notes for Aja

**Data sovereignty preserved:**
- Client-side only processing
- No vendor lock-in
- Can self-host if Netlify becomes problematic
- CSV as canonical format (not proprietary DB)

**Measurement justice alignment:**
- Universal indicators visible alongside strategic
- Collective impact tracked equally
- No hierarchy in data structure
- Filtering respects all three types equally

**Tensions held:**
- Funder compliance vs organizational health (both visible)
- Quantitative metrics vs qualitative context (both included)
- Simplicity for users vs depth for analysts (both achieved via progressive disclosure)

**Not flattened:** Reports can be filtered for specific funders OR show full picture. User choice preserved.
